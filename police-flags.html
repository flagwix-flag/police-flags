<h1>How can you hang an American flag - Police Flags</h1>

<div class="container">


<p>There are many ways you can display the most precious symbol of liberty, the SYMBOL OF LIBERTY.&nbsp;For civilians, there are guidelines on how to display your flag indoors and outdoors.&nbsp;However, the military has a more strict code and set rules more than <a href="https://flagwix.com/collections/united-states/police/">Police flags</a>.&nbsp;Although it may seem simple, improper display of the flag can lead to serious consequences.&nbsp;What are the different ways to display the flag?</p>

<h2>Civilian Uses &amp; Etiquette</h2>

<p>America is the only country that proudly displays its flag.&nbsp;Flag flying is not as common in other countries. Patriotism is less prevalent than it is in the United States.&nbsp;How many times have we passed homes in the United States that had the American flag on their front?&nbsp;It&#39;s probably every day.</p>

<h3>Other than the Home</h3>

<p>A beautiful, domestically-made AMERICAN FLAG can be a great way for you to share your patriotism and love with your neighbors.&nbsp;There are some key points to keep in mind.&nbsp;It is important to ensure that the flag is not touched by any vegetation.&nbsp;Trim those bushes, or find a better place to hang it.</p>

<p>The union flag should be hung in the upper left corner.&nbsp;It&#39;s not the right way to display it.&nbsp;It is possible to accidentally hang the flag upside-down, which could be a sign of something entirely different!</p>

<p>Although it is not required, it is considered appropriate to illuminate the flag between dusk and dawn.&nbsp;The flag should be visible at all times and used as a beacon of liberty.&nbsp;You don&#39;t have to buy a special light for your flag. Instead, hang it where the house lights are already on.&nbsp;This is a great way to shine your flag and save money.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best to bring your flag inside if the weather turns sour.&nbsp;You don&#39;t want the flag to get wet and stormy winds to tear it apart.&nbsp;Allegiance Flag Supply offers a wide range of flags that are strong and beautiful, but can withstand the elements.</p>

<p>Flying other flags beside the American flag is fine, as long as they are not higher or farther to the right than the American flag.&nbsp;The importance of any other symbols is subordinated to our flag.&nbsp;These are only guidelines. While you can do what you like, it is a sign that respect and honor requires that you abide by the rules.</p>

<h3>Indoors and Other Locations</h3>

<p>You don&#39;t have worry about the weather damaging your flag or having it taken down by bad weather.&nbsp;Keep the dust off your flag!&nbsp;It is important to keep the American flag clean.</p>

<p>A friend may have spotted an American flag horizontally pinned to a wall.&nbsp;You shouldn&#39;t hang any flag by drilling holes in it.&nbsp;This is considered disrespectful for the flag.</p>

<p>The flag should be hung vertically or by a pole.&nbsp;People will not be kind to people who poke holes in the flag.&nbsp;Indoor flags are subject to the same rules as outdoor flags.</p>

<p>Like American Storm flags there are American flags which can get wet or be exposed to high winds. These flags are called boat flags.&nbsp;These flags are built to withstand the elements.</p>

<p>Flagwix offers a complete set, which includes the pole made of polymer to hang the BOAT FAG.&nbsp;These flags fly extremely well and don&#39;t accumulate mold.&nbsp;A flag that lasts a lifetime will display the American Ensign on the waters.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the proper manner in which flags are raised outside of your home, at work, or at events so that you can respect our most valuable symbol of democracy and freedom.</p>
